                    <li>
                        I am a very sociable person and I get on well with people of all ages. I get on especially well with children as I find my many years of experience as a babysitter has taught me patience and helped me learn how to interact as best as I can with young children and teenagers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I have volunteered in the Cavan Adventure Centre for children with disabilities and their families. I have also volunteered with the charity Nurture Africa in Uganda who work with and empower vulnerable people. I found both experiences very rewarding and it is something that I would definitely do again.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        From my studies as a Criminal Law and Psychology student I have established a keen interest in a diverse range of topics such as human rights, criminal procedure, the law of evidence, cognition, and applied psychology.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        From my voluntary work and studying modules related to human rights at the University of Limerick I have developed a passion for advocating various aspects of human rights in my future studies and career at a local, national, and international level. I strongly believe in creating a fairer society which does not tolerate any form of prejudice or discrimination.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A long-term goal of mine is to be involved in the drafting of new public policies which will protect and support vulnerable people.
